# CE301---Individual-Capstone-Project-2021
Android Game Development

Introduction

I have chosen to undertake the challenge of Android Game Development, it is very challenging and new to me but I will enjoy learning the way to manipulate data through a new language. 

The best way for me to start this project is by taking courses in order to develop my skills in order to produce a project under my expectations, I have high standards for myself such that I must teach myself the language. 

There are courses on www.developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course which I will go through every single one before starting my own project. This might cost me time to focus on my own project, however, it is for sure worth it.

After I’ve gone through the course, I should have an idea on how to code my project and what features I am able to include.

I have some expectations on my project which I will change after finishing the courses, since I will know what can be implemented and what can’t.

Before courses expectations and requirements:

Minimum Requirements:
•Suitable and human-readable GUI with the basics; Buttons to navigate through the game i.e., Play Button, Quit Button, High-Scores, etc.
•A character which the user controls by touching the screen.
•Some sort of Score system to keep track of the users score.
Not essential requirements:
•Comparing scores to other users, i.e., worldwide high scores.
•Designs, different colour schemes and designs for the character and backgrounds.
•Easy to play, maybe a tutorial if it isn’t self-explanatory.
I will update these requirements each time, I find something interesting to implement or a must needed requirements so the users can enjoy playing the game. I will update Jira on each interface and state I am at.
